PAD is a novel privacy-preserving data publication system that leverages interactions with data users to improve utility of privatized datasets.

The repository contains the source code and demos of PAD in Python.

For a detailed description of the algorithms, see the paper (https://ruoxijia.github.io/assets/papers/pad-buildsys-final.pdf).
